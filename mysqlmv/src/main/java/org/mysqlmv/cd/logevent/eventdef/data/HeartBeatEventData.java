/**
 * A Heartbeat_log_event is sent by a master to a slave to let the slave know that the master is still alive.
 * Events of this type do not appear in the binary or relay logs. They are generated on a master server by the
 * thread that dumps events and sent straight to the slave without ever being written to the binary log.
 * The slave examines the event contents and then discards it without writing it to the relay log.
