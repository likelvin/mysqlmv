 * This is a subclass of Query_log_event that is not written to the log. It is used as a means of flushing a transaction without logging an event.
 * <p/>
 * This event class was added in MySQL 5.0.23 and removed in 6.0.4. It was a solution to Bug#16206 that became unnecessary with the fix for Bug#29020.
